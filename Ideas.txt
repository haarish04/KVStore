Shower ideas, sound easy but complicated asf to implement
Might never implement

-> Handle initializing multiple threads based on number of connections to the PORT to allow concurrent users
-> Check the amount of time taken for individual requests
-> Convert all the "object" variable types to specific types and check difference in time/space
-> Read, write lock for concurrency
-> Atomic updates of data
-> Write tests to check synchronous reads/writes
